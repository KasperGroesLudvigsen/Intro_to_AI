INM701 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence coursework @ City, University of London

To reproduce results:
1. Open train_model.py with Spyder
2. Press "Run File" (F5) - it is important that the script is executed this way, and not by selecting all the code and pressing F9

NOTE! In the submitted code, I have set the number of random search iterations (line 28 and 29) to 1 instead of 500 and 100. This is to make it quick for the reader (Jacob/Atif) to execute the script and verify that it works. 
In order reproduce the results, the variables declared in line 28 and 29 should be set to 500 and 100 respectively.
